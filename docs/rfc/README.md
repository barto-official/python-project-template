# Request for Comments (RFCs)

**Request for Comments (RFCs)** are structured design proposals used to discuss, review, and converge on significant technical changes *before* (or alongside) implementation.

RFCs are the primary mechanism for **early alignment and design review**. They complement Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), which capture the final, long-lived decisions that result from accepted RFCs.

---

## What is an RFC?

An RFC is a proposal document that describes:
- the problem being solved,
- the relevant constraints and requirements,
- one or more viable design options,
- the trade-offs and risks involved,
- and a recommended direction.

RFCs are intended to be reviewed asynchronously and iterated on through feedback. They are not final decision records.

---

## When to write an RFC

The same rules applies as for ADR. Write an RFC when a change is:
- cross-cutting (affects multiple modules/services/teams),
- impacts interfaces or dependencies
- hard or expensive to reverse,
- contract-defining (APIs, events, data schemas),
- operationally risky (security, reliability, scalability),
- or non-obvious with multiple reasonable alternatives.

Do **not** write RFCs for small local refactors or routine implementation details.

## RFCs vs ADRs

| RFC | ADR |
|----|----|
| Proposal and discussion | Final decision record |
| Exploratory and mutable | Stable and long-lived |
| May include open questions | No open questions |
| Used *before* commitment | Used *after* decision |
| Drives alignment | Preserves architectural memory |

**Rule:**  
Accepted RFCs must result in one or more ADRs capturing the final decisions.

## Key principles

- RFCs exist to enable **better decisions, earlier**.
- Discussion belongs in Issues; conclusions belong in documents.
- ADRs preserve decisions; RFCs explore them.
- Prefer clarity and explicit trade-offs over premature certainty.

---

## Where RFCs live

- RFCs are stored in-repo as Markdown files under `docs/rfc/`. It also includes template file.
- Filenames follow the pattern: `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`.
- The RFC document is the **source of truth**.

## Workflow (hybrid model)

1. **Create RFC (Draft)**  
   Copy the RFC template and create `docs/rfc/NNNN-title.md`.

2. **Open discussion (optional but recommended)**  
   Create a GitHub Issue that links to the RFC for comments and feedback. 

3. **Review and iterate**  
   Update the RFC document to reflect conclusions from discussion.

4. **Decision**  
   Update RFC status to `Accepted` or `Rejected`.  
   Record the decision and rationale in the RFC.

5. **Create ADR(s) through PR**  
   For accepted RFCs, create ADR(s) capturing the final decisions

6. **Close discussion**  
   Close the GitHub Issue once the RFC is resolved.

## RFC status lifecycle

Typical statuses:
- `Draft`
- `In Review`
- `Accepted`
- `Rejected`
- `Implemented` 
- `Superseded`
