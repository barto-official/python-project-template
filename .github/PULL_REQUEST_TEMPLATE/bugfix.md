- How does this change address the root cause?
- Why is this approach correct and robust?
-->

## Scope / Impact

<!--
Who is affected and how?

- Affected components / services
- User-facing impact (error, wrong behaviour, data loss)
- Environments impacted: dev / staging / production
-->

## Regression Risk

<!--
Where could this fix cause new issues?

- Other code paths sharing this logic
- Performance implications
- Boundary / edge cases that are now different
