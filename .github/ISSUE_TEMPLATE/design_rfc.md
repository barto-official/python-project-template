## 1. Summary

<!--
One or two sentences describing the proposal at a high level.

Example:
"Introduce a dedicated rate-limiting service to decouple throttling from the API gateway."
-->

## 2. Motivation / Problem Statement

<!--
Why is this change needed?

- What problem are we trying to solve?
- Who is affected (teams, services, users)?
- Why is the current approach insufficient?
-->

## 3. Goals and Non-Goals

### 3.1 Goals

<!--
What does this proposal aim to achieve?
-->

- [ ] …

### 3.2 Non-Goals

<!--
What is explicitly out of scope for this proposal?
This prevents scope creep and misaligned expectations.
-->

- [ ] …

## 4. Proposed Design

<!--
Describe the proposed solution in enough detail for review:

- Architecture overview (components, boundaries, data flow)
- Key interfaces and contracts (APIs, events, schemas)
- Changes to existing components/services
- Data model / schema changes (if any)
-->

### 4.1 High-Level Architecture

<!--
Optional: link or embed diagrams (sequence diagrams, architecture diagrams).
-->

### 4.2 Detailed Design

<!--
Describe important flows and interactions.
Call out critical code paths, patterns, or abstractions.
-->

## 5. Alternatives Considered

<!--
List and briefly evaluate alternative approaches:

- Alternative A: pros/cons
- Alternative B: pros/cons

Explain why the proposed design is preferred.
-->

## 6. Impact Analysis

### 6.1 Backwards Compatibility

<!--
Will existing clients / systems keep working?

- Breaking changes?
- Deprecation strategy?
-->

### 6.2 Operational Impact

<!--
Impact on:

- Performance and resource usage
- Reliability and failure modes
- Deployment, rollout, and rollback
- Monitoring, logging, and alerting
-->

### 6.3 Security / Privacy

<!--
Any security or privacy implications?

- New attack surface?
- Access control changes?
- Data retention or PII considerations?
-->

## 7. Migration / Rollout Plan

<!--
How do we go from the current state to the desired state?

- Phases and milestones
- Feature flags
- Data migrations
- Rollback strategy if the rollout fails
-->

## 8. Open Questions

<!--
List questions that need feedback or decisions.

- Question 1:
- Question 2:
