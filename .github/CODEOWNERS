# CODEOWNERS
# ----------
# This file defines who is responsible for reviewing changes to which parts of the codebase.
# Patterns are matched top-to-bottom and the LAST matching pattern wins.
#
# Owners must be GitHub users or teams, prefixed with @, e.g.:
#   @username
#   @your-org/team-name
#
# Recommended location: .github/CODEOWNERS


# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Global default owner (fallback for everything not matched below)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
*       @barto-official

# EXAMPLES (COMMENTED) — UNCOMMENT/ADAPT AS NEEDED
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# The examples below are commented out so the file is valid as-is.
# Uncomment and customize when you need them.

## Top-level directories
## ----------------------
## Backend code ownership (entire backend/ directory)
# backend/                @your-org/backend-team

## Frontend code ownership (entire frontend/ directory)
# frontend/               @your-org/frontend-team

## Infrastructure / DevOps ownership (infra/ directory)
# infra/                  @your-org/infra-team


## Subdirectories / Domains
## ------------------------
## Payments domain inside backend
# backend/payments/       @your-org/payments-team

## User domain inside backend
# backend/user/           @your-org/user-team

## Notifications domain (multiple teams owning together)
# backend/notifications/  @your-org/notifications-team @your-org/platform-team


## Per-file ownership
## ------------------
## Critical pipeline configuration
# /pyproject.toml         @your-org/backend-team

## CI workflows
# /.github/workflows/ci.yml        @your-org/infra-team
# /.github/workflows/deploy.yml    @your-org/infra-team @your-org/security-team

## Shared API schema file
# /schemas/api/v1/public.json      @your-org/api-review-board @your-org/platform-team


## Pattern-based ownership (globs)
## --------------------------------
## All Python files anywhere in the repo
# *.py                   @your-org/python-guild

## All YAML files under .github/ (workflows, config)
# .github/*.yml          @your-org/infra-team

## All JSON schema files under schemas/ at any depth
# schemas/**/*.json      @your-org/platform-team

## All frontend React components
# frontend/**/*.tsx      @your-org/frontend-team


## Overrides / Special cases
## -------------------------
## Remember: the LAST matching rule in this file takes precedence.
## You can use this to override broad rules with more specific ones.

## Example:
## 1) All backend files go to backend team:
# backend/               @your-org/backend-team
## 2) But payments subdirectory has its own dedicated owners:
# backend/payments/      @your-org/payments-team

## In that case, changes under backend/payments/ will be owned by @your-org/payments-team,
## even though they also match the broader backend/ rule above.
